  subject: The Evolving Community of Appsec
  abstract: Application Security as a discipline has continuously evolved over the last couple of decades. This is an expected outcome of the growth and maturity of this engineering discipline. At the same time, technology has continued to become more pervasive that has led to increased risk associated with appsec failures. On this learning journey, our community has played an important part since the beginning, OWASP being an important contributor to that. In this talk, we will discuss how that community has evolved until now and how it needs to change in the future to enable us to solve future security problems at scale.

  subject: Lessons from the Early Web Application Security Days.
  abstract: I had the privilege to join Perfecto Technologies in its early days (1997), and observe its ascent and demise. Perfecto (later renamed into Sanctum) was a very innovative Israeli startup – the pioneer of commercial web application solutions. Sanctum produced the first WAF, and the first web application vulnerability scanner. In this speech I want to cover the early (and less known) history of Sanctum/Perfecto, how it was intertwined with the early history of web application security (and market), and what lessons I learned from this experience – both about conducting research in an immature area, and about the fate of a security company in an immature market.
